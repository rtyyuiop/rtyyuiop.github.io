      <h3>The Puddle</h3>
<p>A day after rain, I went out walking;</p>
<p>only to see, below, something shocking.</p>
<p>I was stopped by a puddle, serene, still. </p>
<p>The sun would leave me, and dinner be cold,</p>
<p>And parents and homework wonder where I am.</p>
<p>Yet, for a moment, I peered into the puddle,</p>
<p>And felt I had noticed something subtle.</p>
<p>My shoes were worn and dusty from time.</p>
<p>My denim pants were creased with a fine line.</p>
<p>And my shirt, which provides me protection. </p>
<p>Through glasses, an infinite reflection.</p>

<p>Extremes too hard to comprehend at once,</p>
<p>Yet nothing I should care to leave behind.</p>
<p>With all I have to hold with, I will do my best</p>
<p>To keep their building balanced at my breast.</p>
<p>I crouch down to prevent them as they fall;</p>

<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>

<p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
<p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
<p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
<p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
<p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay</p>
<p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
<p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
<p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
<p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
<p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</p>
<p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>
<p>And that has made all the difference.</p>

        <h4>Explication of "The Armful</h4>
        <p>"The Armful" is a poem by Robert Frost which addresses the difficulty of 
        handling many reponsibilities at once through use of a conceit. The first
        line, "For every parcel I stopp down to seize," invokes an image that 
        many will have experienced before, the image of picking up an item, usually an item that has fallen
        out of one's hands. Items in this poem will represent responsibility. The second line, "I lose some other off my arms and knees," expands on the 
        original image; now the reader imagines not only picking up a fallen item,
        but also losing more items from their hands in the process. From a metaphorical perspective, as a person attempts to 
        retake their dropped responsibilities, they inevitably lose others. In the sixth and seventh
        lines, "With all I have to hold with... To keep their building balanced at my breast," 
        Frost now gives the reader the image of trying to balance many things at once against your chest-
        an armful of items. In line eight, "I crouch down to prevent them as they fall," Frost reminds
        us of the first line, although now with a more developed vision. Balancing items while
        having to crouch down in order to prevent them from falling suggests a struggle which is not
        only physically demanding but also requires special attention devoted to the task. Finally, 
        in the ninth line, "Then sit down in the middle of them all," and into the tenth, it is revealed that the person in the poem, who was struggling to
        hold up his or her items, had finally dropped them all. As a result, he or she must 
        think of a way to restack his or her items in a better way. The tone of this ending is optimistic as it tells the reader that the 
        person in this poem is not giving up, but rather will try to find another way to continue carrying their responsibilities. </p>

    <h4>Explication of "The Road Not Taken"</h4>
    <p>“The Road Not Taken” is a poem by Robert Frost in which addresses decision making through the conceit of two roads. In the poem, the unnamed speaker arrives at a fork in the road and is sorrowful that he must make a decision. The speaker attempts to gain insight into what lies ahead by looking down one path until it, “bent into the undergrowth,” where it becomes unknown what lies ahead. The speaker then makes the decision to take the other path, which was just as fair, and attempts to justify his decision by saying that it was, “grassy and wanted wear.” However, he disputes his justification in the next two lines with, “Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same.” The speaker further explains the road’s similarities by pointing out that the roads were, “both equally lay,” and, “in leaves no step had trodden black.” With no road having anything to offer over the other, the speaker decides to save the first road for another day and takes the second. The final stanza starts with, “I shall be telling this with a sigh,” which indicates that the speaker is speaking the presentence now and that he knows that he will regret his decision in the future. The next line goes, “Somewhere ages and ages hence:” tell us that the speaker is now going to speak from a future perspective. The speaker delivers the final three lines, “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference,” which show that the speaker has remembered the occasion differently, justifying his decision for taking one road over the other because one was “less traveled by.” As for whether the difference is positive or not, it is unclear. However, there is an established tone of regret which suggests that either the speaker regrets his decision, or that he regrets not seeing what the other road led to, which goes back to title, “The road not taken.” </p>

          <h5>Rationale</h5>
          <p>I chose both "The Armful" and "The Road Not Taken" because both of them conceits that not only present the reader
          with a familiar image or experience, but also explore topics that many experience on a day to day
          basis. "The Armful" explores the difficulty of handling responsibilities while "The Road Not Taken" explores 
          descision making. Both poems are also very simple. They don't use difficult language or much figurative language, which, as a result, make them more accessable to 
          readers of a lower level or who are not yet able to analyse poems as closely. I believe that many will take this 
          for granted given that most people dislike poetry because they are unable to analyse it or are overwhelmed by big words, "flowery" language, and 
          constant bombardment of literary devices. Rober Frost's "The Armful" and "The Road Not Taken" are peoms which explore common topics 
          through a combination of familiar experiences and easy to understand poetry, and that is why I chose them. </p>
